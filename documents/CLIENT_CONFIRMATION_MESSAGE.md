Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for the clarifications! I've updated both documents to include all the important additions you mentioned. Here's what's been added:

## ✅ Updates Confirmed & Documented

### 1. **"Is this final destination?" Question**
- ✅ Added as **required step** in both seller and buyer scan flows
- ✅ Distinguishes between final delivery and in-transit handoff
- ✅ Recorded in system for tracking purposes

### 2. **New World Penny (NWP) System**

### 4. **Resource Allocation System**
- ✅ **$4 Social Impact:** Goes to Peace Pentagon branch resource
  - Managed by MEGAvoters (who qualify by posting 5-seller karaoke)
  - Or managed by 10 Postmaster Generals (2 from each branch)
- ✅ **$1 Patronage Breakdown:**
  - $0.50 → Credited to YAM'er seller (if applicable)
  - $0.40 → Group bonus → Treasury
  - $0.10 → Treasury allocation → Treasury

### 5. **MEGAvoter Qualification**

- ✅ After qualification: MEGAvoter can manage $4 social impact funds
- ✅ Works alongside 10 PMG for resource management

### 6. **10 Postmaster Generals (PMG) Framework**
